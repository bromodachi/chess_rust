# Overview

A simple command line application of a chess game written in rust. Would work on this for an hour or two for a few days 
late August thus not the cleanest.
Haven't really worked on it since early September as I'm trying different projects every month.

Mostly created to play around with rust and how to design an application.

## Features implemented 

- Checkmate (refer to game_test)
- Movement validations (needs more tests)
- Reading inputs and validating them

## Features to implement 

- Draw (end the game if no piece was taken for 20 turns)
- Undo a move, list last 5 moves(can easily be done.)
- AI
- Online functionality?


## Other improvements

- Clean up the code
- Add more tests
